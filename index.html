    <h2>Gambling Advertising:</h2>
    <P>Gambling Change is a non for profit company that strives to help the astoduning issue that is ruining lives all round the world but also within our own country, As a community and business we look to promote the banning of advirtisemnets along with supporting our community when they need help. Below you can find a petition in order for us to send to parliament.  </P>
    <p>The Australian gambling research centre has conducted some great information and statistics on the exposure that people have on gambling adds. 78% of Australian adults are exposed at least once a week of which 41% of those are exposed at least 4 or more times in a single week. </p>
    <p>Males are more likely to be exposed to gambling advertisements compared to women with most of the advertisements coming on the television or online media. With different age groups it shows that 55+ age group have a strong link to traditional advertisements such as the television where’s as the age black of 18-35 year olds have the new way of advertisements through online media and adds shown on things as Facebook or YouTube. </p>
    <p>The research shown there is a very strong correlation between the exposure of seeing a gambling advertisement and then participating in gambling. The data showed that there was an increase in every category that participated when the user saw an advertisement  more than once a week compared to only once. </p>
    <p>Gambling advertisements these days are crafty with the new generation and offer deals that seem great to hook you in, being classed at a high risk of gambling harm are most likely linked to betting affiliates, direct messages and social media. </p>
    <p>Gambling Adviretising within Australia is becoming a serious issue and action must be takne before more isssues occur, it's almost impoosible now to watch TV without seeing an ad and while watching TV on your phone and being hit with ads on there two, the overwhelming issue needs to be addressed. Here are Gambling Change we want to put the statistics out there to show there is an issues, we also want to highlight if people are dealing with addiction or need help there is people out there that can help you.  </p>

            <h5>Age: 28</h5>

            <h5>Occupation: Tradesman </h5>
                
               <p>James is a hard working Australian embracing the trade and working long hours to support his life style. James has always been very competitive and seemed the thrill of winning throughout all aspects of his life. 
            </p> 
               <p>It all began to change for James once he was at the pub and signed up to a book marker to have a small innocent bet. His friends all had placed bets throughout their time at the pub and James wanted to join them for some fun. James however enjoyed the thrill of winning a little too much and made him continue outside of betting at the pub. He began to realise more messages and emails were coming to him about incentives or new ways to bet. Even going onto his social media to see advertising for a new bookmaker encouraging him to sign up. The ads were catered too James and so good that he would feel impelled to use them. 
            </p> 
               <p>James’ problem had now gotten big where he couldn’t watch a game of sports without betting on them. He began to bet more and more frequently which escaped the amount of money he was losing. As the betting agencies saw this they enticed James through no promotions and deposit matches to keep him hooked. James was losing money fast at this point and was seeking one big bet at a time to win it all back. James was hitting rock bottom and asking friends for money or taking out credit cards in order to fund his lifestyle addiction.
            </p> 
               <p>James at this point was a broken and unwell man with very poor mental health and a shocking addiction, James become distant from his friends and family, yet alone James having to attend his job every time which then saw the impact of his craftsmanship being affected. James had lost everything his friends, money and nearly his job. 
            </p> 
               <p>James was at rock bottom and needed a way out, a friend of his connected him with gambling help online and sought help for his addiction, James started attending weekly meetings and was then comfortable with deleting all his betting apps, setting up ad backers so they couldn’t advertise to him anymore. James then began reaching out to his family and friends for help and to say sorry for all the issues he has caused. James continues to improve every day and hasn’t placed a bet for 24 months.

           <h5>Age: 52</h5>
           <h5>Occupation: Semi Retired </h5>
           <p>Sean is a semi retired man, who has forever worked in the supermarket business through various management jobs. Sean has a wife but they have no children and live a more extravagant lifestyle together. Sean always enjoyed sports and racing but become more attached with his days off spending watching the horse racing around the country. First he enjoyed the power and speed of the racing, but as he got more free time, the long boring days set in and as a way to pass time Sean looked at horse racing. 
        </p>
           <p>Sean was enticed through a betting agency who was running daily specials of money back and he though he would be able to make of the most of his winnings through this feature. What started as having a few bets a week was beginning to turn into a daily occurrence. Sean started on a good winning streak and he thought how easy is this. As the weeks went on Sean was beginning to spend most of his days watching the races and reading the form guide. Seans knowledge of racing was limited but noticed on betting apps their “expert tips” from a racing analyst and turned to placing large amounts of money on these. 
        </p>
           <p>The so called “experts” weren’t helping Sean as he began to lose large chunks of money quickly and proceeded to continue to bet himself to try and win him back. The bookmakers are aware of this and send Sean multiple offers giving him free bets where he can’t lose or offer free race day events. After months of betting and the results of losing money began to take a toll on Sean. Friction began between him and his wife as he would be angry for no apparent reason to her knowledge. Sean was beginning to take his anger out of others. Seans wife began to notice Sean yelling at the TV more frequently and his attitude would continue after the races. She began to proceed to look at bank statements to see how much Sean was spending. 
        </p>
           <p>Sean’s wife who was not happy about the loses approached him and told him to explain everything, she began to say if you keep spending our money like this you will have to go back to full time work and our holidays will stop. Sean was quite taken back by his wife’s approached and began to see there was becoming trouble between them. To Sean’s wife credit she stood by Sean and she seeks helped for him. She took him to weekly counselling and made him join a support gore with problem gamblers all around his age. Sean now has been gambling free for 12 months and looks to continue his retirement.
